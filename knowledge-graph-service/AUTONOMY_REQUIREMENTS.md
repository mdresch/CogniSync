## Conclusion

These autonomy requirements ensure that the Knowledge Graph Service operates as a truly independent microservice while maintaining the ability to integrate effectively with the broader CogniSync platform. The requirements balance autonomy with integration needs, providing clear guidelines for implementation and validation.

Regular review and updates of these requirements should be conducted as the service evolves and new autonomy challenges are identified.
