## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **Webhook Processing**: Real-time processing of Atlassian webhooks
- **Entity Synchronization**: Transforms Confluence/Jira data into Knowledge Graph entities
- **Relationship Management**: Creates and maintains entity relationships
- **User Management**: Maps Atlassian users to Knowledge Graph persons
- **Event Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all sync operations

### HTTP Client Integration
- **Knowledge Graph API**: HTTP client for Knowledge Graph Service communication
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication for service communication
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and comprehensive error management
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Tenant-isolated configurations and data

### Database Schema
- **SyncEvent**: Tracks all webhook processing events
- **SyncConfiguration**: Tenant-specific sync configurations
- **WebhookDelivery**: Webhook delivery tracking and status
- **UserMapping**: Atlassian user to Knowledge Graph entity mapping
- **EntityMapping**: Tracks synchronized entities and their mappings

### API Endpoints
- **Webhook Endpoints**: `/webhooks/:configId` for receiving Atlassian webhooks
- **Configuration API**: `/api/configurations` for managing sync configurations
- **Events API**: `/api/events` for monitoring sync operations
- **Status Endpoint**: `/api/status` for service health monitoring
- **Retry Functionality**: `/api/events/:id/retry` for failed event reprocessing

## 🌐 Service Integration

### HTTP Communication
- **Knowledge Graph Service**: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`
- **Atlassian Sync Service**: `http://localhost:3002`
- **API Authentication**: Bearer token authentication between services

### Webhook URLs
- **Confluence**: `http://localhost:3002/webhooks/{configId}`
- **Jira**: `http://localhost:3002/webhooks/{configId}`
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature validation

## 📊 Sample Data Created

The service includes comprehensive sample data:
- **2 Sync Configurations**: Default Confluence and Jira sync setups
- **3 User Mappings**: Sample Atlassian user mappings
- **4 Entity Mappings**: Confluence pages and Jira issues
- **3 Sync Events**: Successful and failed sync examples
- **3 Webhook Deliveries**: Complete webhook processing history

## 🚀 Service Capabilities

### Event Processing
- **Confluence Events**: page_created, page_updated, page_removed, comment_created
- **Jira Events**: issue_created, issue_updated, issue_deleted, comment_created
- **User Sync**: Automatic user entity creation and management
- **Relationship Creation**: Author, assignee, and content relationships

### Configuration Management
- **Mapping Rules**: Flexible entity and relationship type mappings
- **Filters**: Space, project, and content type filtering

## 🎊 Phase 2B Completion

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

The Atlassian Sync Service has been successfully extracted from the original API Management Platform and implemented as a standalone service. The service now communicates with the Knowledge Graph Service via HTTP APIs instead of direct function calls, providing proper service isolation and scalability.

### Next Steps
- **Phase 2C**: Extract remaining services (Analytics, Reporting, etc.)
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing between services
- **Production Deployment**: Docker containerization and deployment
- **Documentation**: API documentation and integration guides

The CogniSync platform now has two fully functional standalone services:
1. **Knowledge Graph Service** (Port 3001) - Entity and relationship management
2. **Atlassian Sync Service** (Port 3002) - Real-time Confluence/Jira synchronization

Both services are ready for independent deployment and scaling.
